# Metabolic individual-based community model

This repository belongs to our study titled:

"Individual energetics scale up to community coexistence: Movement, metabolism and biodiversity dynamics in fragmented landscapes"

It includes the NetLogo (mibcom_paper.nlogo) and the Python (mibcom_mesa.py) code of a dynamic metabolic individual based home range model for a community of small mammal species (NetLogo version 6.1.0, Python version 3.8). See the publication for a detailed model description (ODD) and full documentation of the modelling (TRACE). We used the NetLogo model for the main study, but programmed the same model in the second programming language python to verify implementation. The Python version has less functionality, especially in output options. For scenario simulation and output in the NetLogo model see the BehaviorSpace included in the Tools section of the model. Both models produce similar results. In the study we use the model to analyze how individual metabolism scales up to community coexistence. We analyze coexistence in differently fragmented landscapes. Simulated data (with the NetLogo model) and code for the figures in the manuscript is also provided.
